# SCIENCE IS EXPLORATION: Computational Frontiers for Conceptual Metaphor Theory

This respository contains the data released alongside the paper "SCIENCE IS EXPLORATION: Computational Frontiers for Conceptual Metaphor Theory" by Rebecca M. M. Hicke and Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan, published in the [CHR 2024 conference](https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org). 

All data files are included in the `data` subfolder. The `MWLB.csv` file contains all 544 example sentences containing conceptual metaphors drawn from "Metaphors We Live By" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. The subsets marked as metaphorical by Lakoff and Johnson are included in a separate column. The files with an `MWLB` prefix followed by the name of one of the three GPT family models -- `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo` -- contain the model output for each MWLB sample. All of the files with the prefix `annotated` contain the same 100 samples from the MWLB dataset with the model outputs and human annotations evaluating those outputs.
